 Mutable classes:

    A mutable class is a class whose instances can be modified after they are created. Mutable classes typically have setter methods that allow you to change the values of their fields, and they may not have defensive copying or other measures to prevent the internal state of an object from being modified.

Here is an example of a mutable class in Java:

public class MutableClass {
  // fields
  private int value;

  // constructor
  public MutableClass(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  // getter and setter methods
  public int getValue() {
    return value;
  }

  public void setValue(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}



b. Immutable classes:

    An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created. Immutable classes typically do not have setter methods and may have defensive copying or other measures to prevent the internal state of an object from being modified.

Here is an example of an immutable class in Java:

public class ImmutableClass {
  // fields
  private final int value;

  // constructor
  public ImmutableClass(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  // getter method
  public int getValue() {
    return value;
  }
}
