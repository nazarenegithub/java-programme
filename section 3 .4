Static variables, also known as class variables, are variables that are shared by all instances of a class. Static variables are defined at the class level and are accessed using the class name, rather than an instance of the class
Instance variables, also known as non-static variables, are variables that are defined at the object level and are unique to each instance of a class. Instance variables are accessed using an instance of the class and are typically used to store state information for an object.

Local variables are variables that are defined within a method or a block of code (e.g., within a pair of curly braces {}) and are only accessible within that method or block of code. Local variables are created when the code block in which they are defined is executed, and they are destroyed when the code block completes execution.
