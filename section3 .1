Here are some key differences between primitive and reference data types:

    Value vs. reference: Primitive data types are value types, while reference data types are reference types.
    Memory allocation: Primitive data types are stored directly in the variable, while reference data types are stored as references to objects in memory.
    Default values: Primitive data types have default values (e.g., 0 for numeric types, false for boolean), while reference data types have a default value of null.
    Operations: Primitive data types support basic operations (e.g., arithmetic, comparison), while reference data types support more complex operations (e.g., method calls, field access).
