    The StringBuffer class is a mutable sequence of characters in Java, which means that you can modify the content of a StringBuffer object after it is created. The StringBuffer class is similar to the String class, but it is more efficient for cases where you need to modify the contents of a string repeatedly, as it does not create a new object each time the string is modified.

    Here is the syntax for creating an object of the StringBuffer class:

StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); // creates an empty string buffer
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(int capacity); // creates a string buffer with the specified capacity
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(String str); // creates a string buffer initialized with the specified string

The StringBuffer class has several methods that allow you to manipulate the contents of the string buffer, such as:

    append(): adds the specified string to the end of the string buffer
    insert(): inserts the specified string at the specified position in the string buffer
    replace(): replaces the specified characters in the string buffer with the specified string
    delete(): deletes the specified characters from the string buffer
    reverse(): reverses the order of the characters in the string buffer
