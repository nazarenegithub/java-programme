    To ensure that variables are used correctly: Initialization ensures that variables are assigned a valid value before they are used. This helps to prevent errors caused by using uninitialized variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

    To avoid default values: Local variables do not have a default value and must be initialized before they can be used. If a local variable is not initialized, it will not have a value and will cause a compile-time error.

    To provide a known starting value: Initialization allows you to set a known starting value for a variable, which can be useful when writing code that depends on the value of the variable.

    To improve readability: Initialization can make your code more readable by explicitly setting the value of a variable at the point of declaration, rather than relying on default values or uninitialized values.
