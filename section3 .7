    Namespace management: Packages provide a namespace for classes and interfaces, which helps to prevent naming conflicts between different classes and interfaces with the same name.

    Reusability: Packages make it easy to reuse code by allowing you to import and use classes and interfaces from other packages in your code.

    Access control: Packages provide a way to control access to classes and interfaces by making them public or private. Public classes and interfaces can be accessed from anywhere in the program, while private classes and interfaces can only be accessed within the package in which they are defined.

    Organization: Packages help to organize your code and make it easier to find and maintain.
