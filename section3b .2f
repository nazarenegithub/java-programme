The output of the program would be:

1 is a digit
 is a Whitespace character
A is an Upper case Letter
0 is a digit
The for loop iterates over the c array in steps of 2, so it skips every other element. Therefore, the loop only processes the elements at indices 1, 3, and 5, which are the characters '1', ' ', and '0'.
