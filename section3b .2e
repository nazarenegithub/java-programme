The output of the program would be:

obmaJ

Here's how the output is calculated:

    On line 4, a new StringBuffer object named str1 is created and initialized with the string "Jambo".
    On line 5, the reverse() method is called on the str1 object, which reverses the order of the characters in the object. The method returns a new StringBuffer object containing the reversed string.
    On line 6, the println() method is called on the str2 object, which prints the contents of the object to the console.
