Widening casting, also known as upcasting, is the process of converting a value from a smaller data type to a larger data type. Widening casting is always safe and does not lose precision, because a larger data type can hold any value that a smaller data type can hold. Widening casting is implicit, which means that it is performed automatically by the compiler.

Narrowing casting, also known as downcasting, is the process of converting a value from a larger data type to a smaller data type. Narrowing casting can lose precision, because a smaller data type may not be able to hold all the values that a larger data type can hold.
