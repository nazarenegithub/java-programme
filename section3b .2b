The output of the program would be:

1 -1 10 10
Here's how the output is calculated:

    ast.indexOf('e') returns the index of the first occurrence of the character 'e' in the string ast, which is 1.
    ast.indexOf('ast') returns the index of the first occurrence of the string "ast" in the string ast, but "ast" does not occur in ast, so the method returns -1.
    ast.lastIndexOf('l') returns the index of the last occurrence of the character 'l' in the string ast, which is 10.
    ast.lastIndexOf('v') returns the index of the last occurrence of the character 'v' in the string ast, which is 10.
